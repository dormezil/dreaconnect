The goal of dreaconnect is to make connecting to database through R easier using drea database schema. Some basic utility functions such as listing tables in a database are also included.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dreaconnect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dormezil/dreaconnect")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

Connect to EDW database. Be sure to assign connection to variable for later use.

```{r example}
library(dreaconnect)
## Connect to edw tables
edw <- edw_connect()
```

Connect to DEVL database. Be sure to assign connection to variable for later use.

```{r}
library(dreaconnect)
## Connect to devl tables
#devl <- devl_connect()
```



List tables in database:
```{r}
#list_tables()
#options include "edw" and "devl". Defaults to "edw"
```


Connect to table:
```{r}
#location_dim_db <- table_connect(edw, "location_dim")
#vpk_wide_db <- table_connect(devl, "vpk_wide", "devl")
```

List EDW Table Dictionary
```{r}
#edw_dictionary()
```
